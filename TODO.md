- For a future project try to make a neural network that can learn from the fluid simulations and figure out how to do it on it's own much faster(similar to something i saw that was cool on 2minutepapers)
- Perhaps use SDL2's OpenGL functions, and possibly use nvidia CUDA libraries to increase performance
- Make MathUtils's matrix normalization support generic template speciialization to specify what type should be used(cleaner code)
- Add a C++ Makefile (and mayb Cmakefile)
- Use dynamic memory allocation on the heap instead of stackf or the runtime cfd vars(using malloc and free ya know)
