- Perhaps use SDL2's OpenGL functions, and possibly use nvidia CUDA libraries to increase performance
- Make MathUtils's matrix normalization support generic template speciialization to specify what type should be used(cleaner code)
- Add a C++ Makefile (and mayb Cmakefile)
- Use dynamic memory allocation on the heap instead of stackf or the runtime cfd vars(using malloc and free ya know)
